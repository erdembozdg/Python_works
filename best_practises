Use precisely the same mechanism to deploy to every environment.

Always include an automated smoke test to check if the release completed successfully.

Build once, and pass the same binary between environments.

Adopt a zero-downtime deployment strategy to enable frequent releases.

Use canary releases and quick rollback to reduce the risk of bugs in the production.
